Cattle is an open source Android client for [饭否](http://fanfou.com/), which is the very first Twitter like service in China, and still running in today's internet. The project want to make a light weight, elegant, and fully functionality client for those Android users. Also it will try to implement the newest and most fashion Android tech as much as I can.

The basic Android architecture is MVP and MVVM in this project. I use RxJava2 along with Retrofit too. Kotlin is primary language in code base.

This project is currently under construction. For those can't wait until it to be published to Google Play, a very first version can be found in the `release` tab.

If you want to build the project by yourself, you may need to apply for a fanfou key from [here](http://fanfou.com/apps); A further instruction may be provided in the future.
